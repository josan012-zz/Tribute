    "readme": "# Create Next App\n\nThe easiest way to get started with Next.js is by using `create-next-app`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you. You can create a new app using the default Next.js template, or by using one of the [official Next.js examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples). To get started, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app\n```\n\nOr, for a [TypeScript project](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/basic-features/typescript.md):\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app --typescript\n```\n\nTo create a new app in a specific folder, you can send a name as an argument. For example, the following command will create a new Next.js app called `blog-app` in a folder with the same name:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app blog-app\n```\n\n## Options\n\n`create-next-app` comes with the following options:\n\n- **--ts, --typescript** - Initialize as a TypeScript project.\n- **-e, --example [name]|[github-url]** - An example to bootstrap the app with. You can use an example name from the [Next.js repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples) or a GitHub URL. The URL can use any branch and/or subdirectory.\n- **--example-path &lt;path-to-example&gt;** - In a rare case, your GitHub URL might contain a branch name with a slash (e.g. bug/fix-1) and the path to the example (e.g. foo/bar). In this case, you must specify the path to the example separately: `--example-path foo/bar`\n- **--use-npm** - Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using npm. To bootstrap using yarn we recommend to run `yarn create next-app`\n\n## Why use Create Next App?\n\n`create-next-app` allows you to create a new Next.js app within seconds. It is officially maintained by the creators of Next.js, and includes a number of benefits:\n\n- **Interactive Experience**: Running `npx create-next-app` (with no arguments) launches an interactive experience that guides you through setting up a project.\n- **Zero Dependencies**: Initializing a project is as quick as one second. Create Next App has zero dependencies.\n- **Offline Support**: Create Next App will automatically detect if you're offline and bootstrap your project using your local package cache.\n- **Support for Examples**: Create Next App can bootstrap your application using an example from the Next.js examples collection (e.g. `npx create-next-app --example api-routes`).\n- **Tested**: The package is part of the Next.js monorepo and tested using the same integration test suite as Next.js itself, ensuring it works as expected with every release.\n",
